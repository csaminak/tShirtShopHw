Learning Objectives

Let's get some more practice with HTML and CSS, including transitions and transforms. We should become more comfortable writing basic, semantic HTML and CSS in addition to practicing our new concepts.

Your Mission

Replicate the following layout using HTML and CSS only:

tshirts.gif

When the mouse hovers over the color or size menu options show the sub-menus
Note that the t-shirt rotation is EPIC Mode
Add animations without using any JavaScript!
The t-shirt items should collapse to one column on sufficiently small screens.
In other words, the site is usable on any size screen and does not scroll left-to-right on smaller screens.
Use Font Awesome for the icons
You can include this CSS stylesheet for those icons.
Use these images for the shirts: shirts.zip (501 KB)
When you're done, push your work to a new repository on Github and submit the link.

Additionally, deploy your site on Github pages, and add a README.md file to the repo which contains a link to the Github pages site.

EPIC Mode

Add the shirt rotation interaction (you may use JavaScript for this part).
